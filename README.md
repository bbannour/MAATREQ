# Demo of MAAT REQ Proof Of Concept to Support Timed Requirements Design Using Algebraic Process Models

The objective of the demo is to present the capabilities of the MAAT REQ Proof Of Concept to improve requirements using formal analysis and testing techniques: functional requirement design, transformation into Process Algebra (PA) and analysis, illustrated on a didactic example of an Alarm System. We can test whether certain requirements can be covered at some point in the PA execution with traceability feedback. Moreover, we can detect various requirement inconsistencies that the tool can highlight as synchronization lacks or deadlocks in the PA execution.
